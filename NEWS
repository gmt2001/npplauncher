* What's new in version 0.5

- 64-bit Windows are supported now.

- Built-in installer is available. Rename executable file to install.exe if
  you want to use it. Installer copies .exe as notepad.exe to 4 locations:
  - %WINDIR%\ServicePackFiles\i386\
  - %WINDIR%\system32\dllcache\
  - %WINDIR%\system32\
  - %WINDIR%\
  But before, it tries to bypass System File Checker/Windows File Protection.

- Moving Notepad++ window to the top has been fixed.

- Building toolchain has changed from MinGW to MinGW-W64.

* What's new in version 0.2

- Always move Notepad++ window to the top.

* What's new in version 0.1 (refering to last St√©pho's version)

- WaitForInputIdle()/WaitForSingleObject() functions are now called to ensure
  proper behavior -- fixes early launcher exit.
